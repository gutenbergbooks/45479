    <h2>
      JOAN OF ARC
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his lecture on
      Joan of Arc, delivered some time ago, provoked a great deal of criticism
      in Chicago. The people who protested against it and wanted to punish its
      author were, naturally enough, the Roman Catholics. What interests me in
      Joan of Arc is not the fact that the story of her martyrdom and subsequent
      canonization could be used as a weapon against the Church of Rome, but
      because the story in itself is so very compelling. It is quite true that
      the story also illustrates how far from infallible the Catholic Church has
      been in its dealings with the Maid of Orleans&mdash;first, burning her at
      the stake as a witch, and, five hundred years later, beatifying her as a
      saint. The statement in my lecture which caused the greatest displeasure
      was to the effect that the same church which had burnt Joan of Arc as a
      witch in fourteen hundred thirty-one had sainted her in nineteen hundred
      and nine. The Catholics deny that they were at all responsible for the
      terrible death of the deliverer of France. This lecture will throw some
      light on that question.
    </p>
    <p>
      As related in a former lecture, it was at her shrine, in the Church of the
      Sacred Heart, in Paris, last summer, that I promised myself the task of
      presenting to the American people the truth about Joan of Arc. I shall
      speak very plainly in this lecture, but, I am sure, without any trace of
      bitterness in my heart toward anyone. I shall speak with feeling, of
      course, for it is impossible not to be moved to the depths by the events
      which brought a girl of nineteen to the stake&mdash;but my passion is free
      from anger or prejudice. I can weep for this young woman without gnashing
      my teeth on her fanatical persecutors. I am sure I can tell the truth
      without lying about the Catholic Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I do not wish to be sentimental, either. I have not forgiven the
      unrepentant destroyers of the innocent. To convert a heretic into a saint
      by trying to prove that she was not a heretic at all is not repentance; it
      is sophistry. To deny that Joan suffered death at the hands of, and by the
      authority of, the Vicar of Christ on earth is not a sign of regret for the
      past, but a defiance of history. When the Catholics shall admit that,
      through ignorance, and urged on by circumstances they could not control,
      they committed the act which they have since atoned for by offering her a
      heavenly crown&mdash;when, I say, the Catholics shall shed over her body
      tears as genuine as those which black Othello shed over the woman he had
      smothered&mdash;then we will forgive them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Catholic Church will have to choose between securing our
      forgiveness and retaining her infallibility. If she should repent of a
      single act ever committed by her officially, she would lose her claim to
      infallibility&mdash;for how can the infallible err? If, on the other hand,
      she should hold to her infallibility, how can she be sorry for anything
      she has ever done? If I had any influence with the Catholics I would
      advise them to sacrifice infallibility for the respect of humanity. It is
      much more divine to say, "I am sorry," than to say, "I am infallible." But
      the Catholic Church will not take my advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shrine of Joan in the Paris church is almost as eloquent as her stake
      in Rouen. I have seen them both&mdash;that is to say, I have seen the spot
      on which she was consumed, marked by a white slab; and I have seen the
      marble figure of Joan, as a girl, in the attitude of prayer, now in the
      Church of the Sacred Heart in Paris. As I stood at her shrine in this
      great white church it seemed to me that, even though Joan of Arc has, at
      last been made a saint, there was still a prejudice against her on the
      part of the people, as well as of the priests. This is only an impression,
      and I hope I am mistaken. But let me present the evidence on which I base
      my misgivings: In the first place, Joan is not given the preference in the
      shrine set apart for her. St. Michael, whoever he might be, occupies the
      whole front of the altar, and only on the windows and the side walls do we
      find any mention of Joan and the events of her heroic career. There is
      also, at one end of the enclosure, as intimated before, a small marble
      figure of Joan on her knees. Why does St. Michael usurp the place of honor
      over the altar? Who is he? What has he done for France? In the second
      place, there was not a single lighted candle at her shrine. St. Mary's
      altar, a little distance off, was ablaze. St. Joseph's, too, was honored
      by lighted candles. But no one was on her knees and no flame twinkled
      before the sainted Joan of Arc. They say that it is almost impossible to
      outlive the charge of heresy. In former times, quite frequently, even
      heretics who repented of their heresies were put to death, nevertheless.
      To have ever been accused, even, or suspected of heresy, is an
      unpardonable crime. Joan was suspected, at least, of rebellion against
      Rome, and it seemed to me, as I reflected upon what I observed in the
      church, that the Catholics had canonized this village maid reluctantly,
      and only under pressure, and after five hundred years of dillydallying.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before I left the Church of the Sacred Heart there was a lighted
      candle upon her altar. I lighted it. Approaching one of the candle tables,
      of which there are half a dozen in the building, I purchased a long,
      tapering candle, white as the lily, and I touched it with fire&mdash;I
      kindled it and set it in one of the sockets to burn before the kneeling
      Joan. I left my flaming candle in the Church of the Sacred Heart! I, a
      non-Catholic, offered my fire to Joan, not because she had been canonized&mdash;for
      I never wait for the consent or the approval of the Pope before paying
      homage to anybody&mdash;but because her sweet, sad story is one of the
      most moving of modern times, and her vindication one of the most
      stupendous conquests of modern thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Church of the Sacred Heart is one of the most beautiful in Paris. It
      is built on the highest point in the city and commands a wonderful view.
      As I have told you before, I have two friends who dwell on this summit&mdash;really,
      a superb location. It is approached by a long flight of stairs, or by a
      cog-wheel train. Before it, and all around it, sweeps the Paris of to-day,
      as did the Paris of Clovis and Charlemagne, nearly fifteen hundred years
      ago; the Paris of Julian, Emperor of Rome, older still; the Catholic
      Paris, when kings and parlements bowed low to kiss the great toe of the
      Italian Christ, or his vicar; the Paris of the Medici&mdash;red and
      bloody; the Paris of the Huguenots, of Henry of Navarre, of Conde and
      Colligny&mdash;sad, desolate, and in the throes of a new faith; and the
      Paris of the philosophers, whose smile softened its barbarities, lit up
      its darkness, and made it a city of light&mdash;<i>La ville Lumiere!</i>
      There, on that splendid elevation, live my two young friends. They are
      both at the age of nineteen. One of them a lad, the other a maid. The girl
      is housed; the boy is exposed. Joan of Arc lives in the church&mdash;the
      cathedral is her home. The Chevalier de La Barre stands on the edge of the
      hill, with sun and shower falling upon his head. The Catholic Church burnt
      them both at the stake&mdash;the boy and the girl; the one because he did
      not tip his hat to the priest at a street procession, the other because
      she believed in herself! But modern thought has vindicated both of these
      outcasts. Joan now dwells in a white church, perfumed and lighted; and the
      Chevalier crowns the brow of the hill with his youthful figure and
      appealing gesture. The chain which tied these children to the stake in a
      dark age has flowered! Is not that wonderful? I believe in the forces, the
      ideas, the movement&mdash;the thought that can cause a chain to flower!
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not going to speak this morning of the Chevalier de La Barre, to
      commemorate whose memory the nationalists of France have erected this
      monument, close to the Church of the Sacred Heart. He will be my theme on
      another occasion. In this lecture I shall confine myself to the story of
      Joan of Arc. And a strange story it is! A young girl of seventeen marches
      at the head of a dilapidated and demoralized army, and leads it on to
      victory against the best fighters of the world, the English, who, in the
      fifteenth century, were trying to annex France to England; she is captured
      by traitors, sold to the enemy for ten thousand pounds; and then she is
      handed over to the church to be tried for heresy. She is tried, convicted,
      and sentenced to be burned alive. This sentence, the most revolting on
      record, is carried out in all its literalness, and in broad daylight, and
      under the shadow of the Christian cross, and at the very doors of a great
      cathedral. All this transpired in the city of Rouen, on the thirtieth day
      of May, fourteen hundred thirty-one.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order that I may enter into the spirit of the thrilling events of which
      Rouen was the stage, I repaired to that city, and reverently visited the
      scenes of the trial and the martyrdom of this latest saint of the Catholic
      world. Words cannot convey to you the emotions which, like a storm, burst
      upon me suddenly as the conductor on my train called out, "Rouen!" It was
      then about a half hour to midnight, and, jumping into a carriage, I was
      quickly driven to my hotel. What thoughts, and how they crowded in upon
      me, as soon as I laid my head upon my pillow. My brain was too active to
      permit of sleep. I imagined I was living in <i>the year fourteen hundred
      thirty-one</i>, and that I had just reached this city on the eve of the
      martyrdom of Joan. "To-morrow," I whispered to myself, "Joan of Arc will
      be led to the stake." Again and again I repeated to my pillow this
      shuddering intelligence. "What," I exclaimed to myself, "a young woman who
      saved France by her courage is going to be committed to the flames in this
      very city <i>tomorrow!</i>" I could not believe it possible. I could not
      believe that there was folly enough, or hatred enough, or stupidity
      enough, in the world for so desperate a deed. But, alas, it was true. With
      my eyes closed, I fancied I saw the throngs marching through the streets&mdash;consisting
      of peasants, of merchants, of priests, of princes&mdash;to see a girl of
      nineteen burned in the fire, and in all that throng there was not one who
      had either a kind word or thought for her&mdash;her who had given them a
      country to live in. Abandoned, hated and spat upon, she was left to suffer
      the cruelest punishment that human <i>inhumanity</i> could devise, or the
      most perverse imagination invent. A girl of nineteen burned alive! "Oh,
      God!" The words escaped my lips in spite of me. Then I turned about and
      called upon <i>Humanity</i>. But in the fifteenth century God and Humanity
      were both hard of hearing. Then I called upon <i>Science</i> and <i>Reason</i>.
      But these were not yet born. "There is no help then," I whispered to
      myself, and my heart swelled within me with indignation, and I became
      desperate, realizing my helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      With my head upon my pillow during that first night I spent in Rouen, I
      tried to penetrate into the motives for the persecution of Joan. This
      brave girl was feared because she was superior to her age. She provoked
      the jealousy of her inferiors. Her independence and originality alarmed
      both the Church and the State. Her ability to take the initiative, and her
      courage to disagree with her spiritual teachers was a menace to the
      authority of the priest with the keys, and the king with the sword. The
      English would not admit that a mere girl, a Domremy peasant, tending her
      father's cows, could have the genius to whip them&mdash;the most powerful
      warriors of Europe. The Catholic Church, on the other hand, would not
      forgive Joan for distinguishing herself without their help. For a woman to
      eclipse the Holy Church and humiliate a powerful State, was a crime
      punishable by death.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than two years' time Joan had saved France, after the prayers of
      the Church and the armies of the nation had failed ignominiously. In the
      opinion of the world of that day there was only one power, the devil's,
      that could outwit the Church. It was not denied that Joan had driven the
      victorious armies of the enemy out of France, and made a conquered people
      free again; but it was argued that she had achieved this triumph, not by
      the help of God, but by the instrumentality of the devil. In those days,
      anything, however praiseworthy, if accomplished without the permission and
      cooperation of the Church, was the work of the devil. Joan had consulted
      her own heart, instead of the village confessor. That was her heresy. Joan
      had seen visions and heard voices on her own account. That is the
      independence which, if encouraged, or even recognized, would overthrow the
      Catholic Church. No one is allowed to receive revelations at first hand.
      Even God is not permitted to speak except through his vicar on earth. In
      short, Joan was a <i>protestant</i>, inasmuch as she not only had direct
      relations with heaven, but she refused to allow the Church to be the judge
      as to whether her voices were from God or from Satan. During all the agony
      of her long trial, every effort was made to induce her to allow the Church
      to be the judge of the nature of her visions. Joan refused the test. There
      was no doubt about her heresy. She believed herself capable of judging.
      That was her unpardonable sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still imagining myself in Rouen, in the year fourteen hundred thirty-one,
      I said to myself, "I must arise early in the morning and go to the old
      market place to catch a glimpse of the wonderful woman when she leaves the
      tower for the stake." As the picture of what I would see on the following
      day arose before my closed eyes, I trembled. "I will not let them burn
      her," I cried passionately. But, alas, what could one man do against king,
      pope, and the mob! And I tossed in my bed like one in a cage who is
      conscious of his helplessness against iron bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, a thought struck me, as the lightning strikes a tree. "This is
      fourteen hundred thirty-one," I repeated to myself. "I must get up at once
      and repair to the palace of the Bishop of Beauvais, the priest who holds
      in the hollow of his hand the fate of the bravest maid in history. If I
      could only have a half hour with him," I said, "to pour into his ears my
      protest, my pleadings, my scorn, my prayers; or, if I could tell him of
      the time when Joan will have a shrine in a Catholic Church!&mdash;he might
      relent and hearken unto reason?" With these thoughts in my mind I jumped
      out of my bed, I lit the candle, I put on my clothes. Then, in haste, I
      walked out into the night, seeking my way in the streets of the strange
      city now deserted. By the help of the moon and the stars of that night in
      May, <i>fourteen hundred thirty-one</i>, I traced my way to the imposing
      Cathedral of St. Ouen, standing like a towering shadow in the cold light
      of the night, and close to which lived the Bishop of Beauvais.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knocked upon the Bishop's door. "Open, open," I cried, as in the dead of
      night I kept pounding upon the door. "I wish to come in," I cried. "I wish
      to save the Church from an indelible stain, I wish to protect the honor of
      humanity." "Open, open," I cried, again and again, and in the stillness of
      the night the noise of my blows reached far and wide. Louder and louder
      still I cried to the Bishop to open the door. "I wish to rescue France and
      England from committing an act of infamy; I wish to save history from an
      unspeakable shame. Let me in, Bishop! I come to protect you against the
      execration of posterity, against eternal damnation! Open, open the door!"
      I shouted. I kept pounding upon the door, long and loud, on the eve of
      that foul day in fourteen hundred thirty-one. I grew impatient with
      waiting for the door to open, and my voice, which a moment before swept up
      and down the whole gamut of hope and despair&mdash;pleading, shouting,
      sobbing&mdash;now became faint and feeble.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not arouse the Bishop. He was fast asleep. Then I was silent
      myself. Suddenly I heard a far away whisper. It did not come from the
      Episcopal palace, nor from the Cathedral close by, yet I was sure I heard
      some one speaking. I listened again. I could now hear more clearly. "I am
      coming, I am coming," was repeated in caressing accents. "I am coming, to
      open the door, to awaken the Bishop, to usher in a more joyous day for
      humanity. I will extinguish the fires of persecution, turn executioners
      into teachers, disarm superstition, and make the whole world sane. In that
      day Joan will triumph over her foes and make their churches her
      mausoleum." It was the voice of Reason! But it took five hundred years for
      that faint whisper to swell into a mighty chorus, swinging around the
      globe. That prophecy has been fulfilled, the Bishop's door opened, and the
      Church yielded to the clamor of civilization, and changed Joan's stake
      into the shrine where I lit my candle in her honor, in the Church of the
      Sacred Heart. She is no longer a heretic, she has become a saint. Her
      tears have changed into pearls, her tomb into a cathedral, where she
      sleeps in pomp on the bosom that once stung her to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was not in Rouen in fourteen hundred thirty-one; I was there five
      hundred years too late. The day after I arrived in the city, I went to the
      market place, but, instead of a procession with candles and torches, with
      stakes and fagots, I found commerce, industry, labor, in full possession
      of the great square. Prosperous looking men and women met and greeted one
      another pleasantly; farmers were selling fruit and vegetables; the women,
      flowers. Even the priests one came across smiled as they saw the happy
      countenances of the people. What a change! Common sense has sweetened
      human nature and flooded the mind with the light that destroys
      superstition and makes all men brothers. The guide pointed out to me the
      white marble slab marking the spot on which Joan of Arc met her death.
      "Upon this place stood the stake of Joan of Arc. The ashes of the glorious
      virgin were thrown into the Seine." This is the inscription on the slab
      which was placed there by the municipality in eighteen hundred ninety-one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close to this same spot the citizens of Rouen have erected a fountain, in
      the form of a monument, to the same heroic maiden. I stood and watched the
      playful waters as they fell with a liquid plash into the marble basin
      below. Presently, a woman came along with her pitcher. The stake at which
      Joan of Arc was burned to death has become a fountain, to which the people
      now come to slake their thirst. Walking up to the woman, I said, "What
      fountain is this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, monsieur," she exclaimed, "behold the fountain of Joan of Arc."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she was a heretic," I remarked. I can never forget her smile. The sun
      had arisen in her eyes. "We live in the twentieth century," she replied.
      And, unconsciously, we both heaved a sigh of relief. I rubbed my eyes to
      be sure we were not living in the middle ages, when Rationalism was still
      a babe in swaddling clothes, and Theology was lord of all. This is the
      twentieth century&mdash;for we are drinking at the fountain of Joan of Arc
      instead of carrying fagots to her stake! One of the sunniest spots in my
      memory will be my meeting with this peasant woman, with her pitcher, at
      the fountain of Joan of Arc.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my object in this lecture is to help clear some obscure questions in
      connection with the trial, martyrdom and subsequent canonization of this
      girl of nineteen. I wish to bring about a more intelligent appreciation of
      the story of a young shepherdess, beginning from the day she left her home
      in Domremy, to the fiery scaffold; and thence to a place among the saints
      in the Catholic calendar. This is the only instance in Catholic history of
      a person once destroyed as a heretic who has afterwards received the
      highest honors within the gift of the Church. In fourteen hundred
      thirty-one an infallible body of ecclesiastics pronounced this young woman
      to be "a child of perdition, a sorceress, a seducer, a harlot and a
      heretic." Five hundred years after, another infallible body of
      ecclesiastics belonging to the same church pronounced the same "harlot"
      and "heretic" to be "angelic" and "divine." One infallible pope allowed
      her to be burned in fourteen hundred thirty-one; another infallible pope
      denounced her murderers as detestable criminals&mdash;which shows how
      fallible is infallibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great many untruths are being circulated to help clear this
      contradiction. The clergy are proclaiming from the housetops that it was
      not the church that tried and condemned Joan of Arc to torture and death
      in fourteen hundred thirty-one; on the contrary, it was the church, they
      say, which has just vindicated her memory and beatified her with superb
      ceremonies. History, however, gives a different version of the affair.
      Before proceeding to describe the trial and condemnation of Joan of Arc,
      let me state the attitude of the Rationalist toward Joan of Arc's claims
      to inspiration. We can do justice to a woman of her description without
      believing in miraculous predictions. Joan of Arc claimed to have seen
      visions and to have heard voices, which assured her of her divine mission.
      She was thirteen years of age, according to her testimony, when she felt
      her first thrill. The visions were repeated. One day, at about noon, in
      the summer time, and while working on her father's farm, close to the
      whispering trees, she saw a radiance out of which came a voice which she
      fancied was the voice of an angel or of a saint. It was not at all strange
      that she should hear voices. All her education had prepared her for them.
      She had been told how others had seen angels and heard voices. The
      literature of the Church was full of the miraculous in those days. It was
      the ambition of every believer to receive visits from the other world, and
      to be told secrets. Joan, the little Domremy girl, shared these ambitions.
      In her case the wish was father to the vision. She heard the voices and
      saw the faces which her heart coveted. How do we explain her "voices" and
      her "visions"? The question is a very simple one, unless we have a leaning
      for theology. The voices that Joan heard were those that came from her own
      heart. It was her own dreams she saw in the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman had mused over the acts of brigandage of the invading army
      and their French allies; she had seen the smoke of the burning villages
      and had heard the wail of her peasant neighbors. The distress of her
      people had often melted her into tears and wrung many a sigh from her
      lips. She imagined the whole country summoning her to the rescue. So
      earnest was she that her thoughts assumed form and shape, and became
      vocal. Thus, out of the substance of her own soul she fashioned the
      visions which she beheld. She felt herself set apart to be the saviour of
      France. The brilliance of that thought darkened every other object in life&mdash;home,
      parents, money, marriage!
    </p>
    <p>
      To those who will not be satisfied with this explanation, I beg to say
      that if the voices were really supernatural, then they should be held
      responsible for the cruel death to which they led or drove the young
      woman. Why did her voices, if they were divine, desert her when she needed
      their help most? Why did they not save her from prison and the stake? And
      which of us would like to be guided to the chambers of the inquisition,
      and the flames of the stake by "heavenly voices"? Moreover, if these
      voices came from God, why did they not speak to the English king, or to
      the Roman pope, in behalf of Joan, when she called on them for help? Why
      did they not assume the responsibility for the acts for which she was
      destroyed? Voices and visions which induce a young girl to go to the help
      of a perishing country only to use her victories for the benefit of a
      depraved and imbecile prince like Charles VII, and desert the young woman
      herself to be "done" to death! Defend us against them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to the question of the responsibility of the Catholic Church for
      the fate of Joan, there are these points to be touched upon. Being a
      matter of history that on the last day of May, fourteen hundred
      thirty-one, this young woman was publicly burned in the City of Rouen, in
      the square of the cathedral, the question arises: Who put her to death?
      Another important question is: Why was she put to death? And when we have
      answered these questions we will be in a position to discuss the much more
      important question of: Why Joan of Arc was recently translated into a
      saint by the pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-five years after the burning of Joan, when the city of Rouen was
      restored to the French king, and the English were finally driven across
      the Channel, it was decided to review the evidence upon which the Maid had
      been convicted and put to death. This was done; and with the result that
      she was acquitted of all the charges of heresy, insubordination to the
      Church, adultery, witchcraft, etc. What do you think was the motive of
      this revision? The French king had begun to realize the disgrace to which
      he had been exposed by the condemnation of the Maid as a witch. Being
      exceedingly pious&mdash;piety and crime were united in him as in many
      others of that day&mdash;he was tormented by the thought that the young
      woman who had assisted him in his war against the English, and had been
      the means of securing for him the crown of France, and had also officiated
      at his coronation in the cathedral of Rheims, was condemned as an agent of
      satan by the Church; which, if true, it would make him not only the target
      for the ridicule and derision of the whole Christian world, but, also, an
      illicit king of the French, who might refuse their allegiance to him
      because he was made king by a witch and not by an apostle of God. It is no
      wonder that a superstitious man like Charles VII, in a superstitious age,
      trembled, not only for his crown, but, also, for his life. Therefore, in
      order to make his succession legitimate it was necessary to prove that
      Joan was not a witch, but a true messenger of God. For if Joan was a
      witch, Charles VII was not king "by the grace of God," but by a trick of
      the devil. In self-defense the king of France was not only compelled to
      reopen the case against Joan, now that he was free from English dictation,
      but he also indicated in advance to the ecclesiastics the conclusion they
      would have to arrive at. The king could not have allowed, and he would not
      have allowed, the ecclesiastical council, convened at his request, to
      arrive at any other verdict than the one which would prove to France and
      Christendom that he was made king at Rheims, not by a witch who was
      excommunicated by the Church and flung into the fire, but by a real and
      inspired apostle of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it is a matter of history that it was by the help of Joan that
      Charles VII became King of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      As already intimated, at the coronation ceremony Joan was not only
      present, but she assisted the Archbishop when the latter placed the crown
      upon the king's head. The inauguration was practically the work of Joan.
      It was the fulfillment of a prediction she had repeatedly made, that she
      would conquer the English and crown the French king in the City of Rheims.
      If she was a witch the coronation was invalid. The ceremony of the
      anointing of a king is one of the most solemn in the Catholic Church. The
      condemnation of Joan as a witch had not only stripped this ceremony of its
      sacredness, but it had also made it null and void, nay, more, a blasphemy.
      How could a king, anointed by the help of a witch, be the king of a
      Christian nation? To appreciate this argument we must remember how bigoted
      the people were in the Middle Ages. In self-defense, therefore, Charles
      VII was compelled to prove to the French, and to the whole world, that the
      woman to whom he owed his elevation to the throne was not a heretic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us recapitulate. The King of France ordered the Church to make out a
      new certificate for Joan. The Church obeyed the French king, even as the
      same Church twenty-five years earlier had obeyed the King of England and
      condemned Joan to death. When the English were masters of France, the
      Catholic Church pleased them by delivering up the conqueror of England to
      be burned alive; when the English were driven out of the country and the
      French were again in control this sentence was reversed and Joan was
      proven to have been a dutiful child of the Church. Thus it will be seen
      that the Church swung with the English when the English ruled the land,
      and she swung with the French when the French had driven the English out
      of the country. The Church was with England at one time, and she was with
      France at another&mdash;but never with Joan. I am milder in my criticism
      than the facts warrant. I am making strenuous efforts to speak with
      immoderation of an "infallible institution."
    </p>
    <p>
      But why was it to the interest of the English to have Joan declared a
      witch? Their motives were as personal as those of the French king. The
      English felt humiliated to think that a mere woman had whipped them, and
      therefore they were determined to prove that she was more than a woman&mdash;an
      agent of the devil. There was no secret about this. Their motive was very
      plain. It was to their interest to show that Joan was the personification
      of satan, and that consequently the English should not be blamed for
      running away from her presence, because who could withstand the devil? The
      English army did not go down before a girl, but before a sorceress. Even
      as the King of France did not wish it said that he owed his victory over
      the English to a witch, or that he was made king by an apostate, the
      English did not wish it said that they were conquered by a saint, for that
      would make God the enemy of the English. One king wanted Joan damned, and
      the Church accommodated him by damning her; another wanted Joan beatified,
      and the Church beatified her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is admitted that the English could not have burned Joan as a witch
      without the consent of the Church. They could have burned her as a
      prisoner, but that would not have answered their purpose&mdash;she must be
      declared a witch in order to vindicate the amour propre of the English
      people. It is the exclusive prerogative of the Church to decide questions
      of orthodoxy or heresy. No king has the right to admit or exclude any one
      from the communion of the Church. Whether or not Joan was a witch was a
      theological question and could only be decided by the ecclesiastical
      court. Neither could the King of France declare Joan of Arc innocent of
      heresy without the consent of the Church. It follows then that the
      principal actor in the trial, the condemnation and the death of the young
      woman under the English, and her subsequent vindication and beatification,
      was the Church of Rome, since without its consent the English could not
      have made a heretic of her, nor the French a saviour and a saint. A
      secular government may declare who shall be its military heroes, or who
      shall be court-martialed and disgraced, but only the Church enjoys the
      right to damn or to canonize. This point is so clinching that even the
      most zealous papist must admit that at one time, when all Europe was
      Catholic&mdash;England as much so as France&mdash;and the pope was as
      supreme in one country as in the other, a girl of nineteen, who had
      rendered heroic services to her oppressed country, could not have been
      declared a heretic and cast into the fire at the door of a cathedral, in
      the presence of bishops, priests, a cardinal and a representative of the
      holy Inquisition, without the knowledge and consent of the Holy Roman
      Catholic Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      An attempt has been made to throw the entire blame of the proceedings
      against Joan of Arc upon the English. There is no doubt about the anxiety
      of the English to punish the Maid who had robbed them of the spoils of
      their victory over the French and brought dishonor upon their arms. But a
      mere military punishment, as already intimated, would not have been
      sufficient to satisfy the English&mdash;she had to be excommunicated from
      Christendom as one possessed of the devil. That was the only way to save
      the English of the disgrace of having been beaten by a woman, and the
      records show that the Church, instead of reluctantly carrying out the
      wishes of the English, was more than pleased to bring Joan to the stake.
      Letters were written from the office of the Inquisition to the English
      king, complaining against his lukewarmness in the matter of prosecuting
      the young woman. The Catholic University of Paris, also, sent a special
      communication to King Henry of England to remind him of his duty to help
      the Church to put down heresy. The English were urged to hand Joan over to
      the bishop and the Inquisition, that the ecclesiastics might proceed with
      her trial without delay. And when finally Joan faced her judges, forty in
      number, every one of them was an ecclesiastic, and out of the forty,
      thirty-eight were Frenchmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, the Archbishop of Rheims, who was also Chancellor of France,
      wrote a letter which is still in existence, in which he congratulated the
      French upon the capture of Joan of Arc, whom he denounces as a heretic&mdash;"a
      proud and rebellious child who refuses to submit to the Church." Being the
      superior of the Bishop of Beauvais, who was in charge of the trial, the
      Archbishop could have stopped the prosecution if he had the least sympathy
      or pity for the Maid. But to try to save a heretic would be the worst kind
      of heresy. That explains the utter desertion of Joan by all France&mdash;people,
      priest and king.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this connection a comparison should be made between the zeal of the
      clergy to bring Joan to trial for heresy and the slowness and indifference
      with which the Church proceeded to obey the summons of the King of France
      twenty-five years after to reinstate her into the fellowship of Catholic
      Christendom. The records show that it required considerable urging and
      manoeuvring on the part of the French government to bring about a revision
      of the ecclesiastical sentence against the Maid. As long as Nicholas V was
      pope nothing was accomplished. The case was reopened under Pope Calixtus.
      Not until it was realized that further delay in the matter would greatly
      irritate, not only the French king, but also the populace, now freed from
      English dominion and seeking to live down the evil reputation of having
      harbored an apostate in their midst, did Rome stir itself in the matter.
      It will be seen that it was not the pope nor the Church that took the
      initiative in behalf of Joan of Arc. The Church only yielded to the
      pressure from the State, that had now become powerful. Had the English
      remained in control of France the Maid of Orleans would never have been
      remembered by the Catholic Church, much less restored to honor and
      immortality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do not deny," answer the defenders of the Church, "that <i>some</i>
      bishops and even cardinals persecuted Joan of Arc to death. But is it just
      to hold the whole Church responsible for the crime of an insignificant
      minority?" This is the main defense of the Catholics against the arguments
      of the Rationalists and the facts of history. Be it noted that I am not
      trying to abuse the Catholics; I am only sorry that they should be
      unwilling, even at this date, to say, "We are sorry." To commit mistakes
      is human. But why should the Church move heaven and earth to prove that it
      has never committed a mistake? The attempt is also made to prove that the
      ecclesiastics who are responsible for the death of Joan were wicked men
      and have been repudiated by the Church. To this is added the further
      defense that it was the gold of the English which corrupted these priests.
      But such a defense, I regret to say, does not reflect credit upon the
      intelligence or the honor of the Church of Rome. In this day of general
      information it is impossible for anyone to wrap up the facts of history in
      a napkin, as it were, and put them away where no one may have access to
      them. The judges of Joan were all ordained ministers of the Church. The
      presiding priest was a bishop&mdash;the bishop of Beauvais. He was
      assisted by a cardinal, a vice-president of the Inquisition, and a number
      of other ecclesiastics who were connected with the University of Paris. Is
      it reasonable to suppose that the Inquisition and the Catholic University
      of Paris, and all the clergy of England and France represented only a
      discredited section of the Church?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the pride of the Catholics that their church has never been divided
      or schismatic, and that it has been one and indivisible "always and
      everywhere." How is this claim to be reconciled with the excuse that a
      considerable portion of the Catholic Church in the fifteenth century
      openly ignored the authority of the pope and did as they pleased without
      incurring the displeasure of the Hierarchy for their insubordination?
      Furthermore, if only a part of the church persecuted the young woman, what
      did the rest of the church do to save her? We would like the names of the
      priests who interceded in her behalf. It does not give me a bit of
      pleasure to prove the Catholic Church responsible for this as for many
      other burnings at the stake, but it gives me pleasure to be able to show
      that any institution claiming infallibility, to defend that claim must
      persecute. And why do I take pleasure in proving this to be inevitable? It
      might open the eyes of the religious world to the danger of
      supernaturalism. If the Christians no longer burn people they do not like,
      it is not because their Bibles have been altered, but because they no
      longer believe in them as they used to. It is good news to report that
      supernaturalism is waning, for it means the progress of science and
      sanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is still another point to be touched upon: When all Europe heard of
      the fate that had befallen a girl of nineteen through the machinations,
      let us say, of a few naughty Catholic priests&mdash;what did Rome do to
      these same priests who had so disgraced their "holy" profession, as well
      as brought lasting shame upon civilization? Is not this a pertinent
      question? Joan's trial lasted for four months. Not only France and
      England, but all Christendom was interested in the outcome. During all
      this time not only was there not a word of protest from Rome, but what is
      more significant, shortly after the trial and condemnation of Joan, the
      pope rewarded her accusers and persucutors with ecclesiastical promotion.
      Again, I must hasten to explain that I am not interested in embarrassing
      the Catholics; my point is to strike at <i>dogma</i>&mdash;which turns
      hearts into stone, and makes of the intellect a juggler's instrument. Joan
      was sacrificed, nay,&mdash;the honor of France, of Europe, of
      civilization, of humanity&mdash;was flung into the fire with Joan, to save&mdash;what?
      Dogma!
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only did the church fail to punish a single one of the forty
      ecclesiastics who tried Joan, not to mention hundreds of others who
      cooperated with them to bring about her destruction, but, as intended,
      gifts were conferred upon the principal actors in this awful drama.
      Roussel, one of the ecclesiastics who figured prominently in the
      proceedings, was given the archepiscopacy of the city of Rouen&mdash;the
      very city in which a girl not yet twenty, and who had served France on the
      battlefield, and brought victory to her flag, was beaten and burnt to
      death. Pasquier, an ordinary priest when he was serving as one of the
      judges, was made a bishop after the execution of Joan. Two others, Gilles
      and Le Fevre, were also advanced to upper ranks in the church. Thomas
      Courcelles, one of the most merciless judges of Joan&mdash;who voted in
      favor of subjecting the prisoner to physical torture to compel her to
      admit she was a witch&mdash;this priest with the unenviable reputation was
      also promoted to a lucrative post in the famous church of Notre Dame, in
      Paris. Finally, the man who engineered the trial, who presided over the
      sessions, and to whom Joan said, "You are the cause of my misfortunes"&mdash;the
      Bishop of Beauvais, the man whom all Catholics justly execrate today&mdash;even
      he was rewarded by the "Holy Father"; he was given the episcopal seat of
      Lisieux. Does it look as though the crime against Joan were the work of a
      discredited minority in the Catholic Church? I repeat, it was dogma, it
      was revelation, it was infallibility, it was supernaturalism, and not this
      or that priest&mdash;that should be held guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      To meet these arguments the Catholic apologists call attention to the fact
      that the church "has a horror of blood," and that it has never put anyone
      to death for any cause whatever. But this is true only in a Pickwickian
      sense. It is like the head saying to the hands, "I have never committed
      the least violence against anyone." The hands, it is evident, commit the
      acts, but whose hands are they? The hands only obey the head, and for the
      head to blame the hands for carrying out its orders, realizing its
      thoughts and wishes, would not even be amusing, much less convincing. It
      is the judge, or the court, that takes the life of the culprit, for
      instance, and not the executioner. The Catholic Church demands the death
      of the heretic. Is this denied? Read Thomas Aquinas, the most honored
      saint and theologian of Catholicism; read the decrees of the general
      councils of the church and the encyclicals of St. Peter's successors, and
      a thousand, thousand proofs will be found in them to substantiate the
      statement. It is the Bible that commands the death of the heretic. No
      church founded on the Bible can afford to be tolerant. The theory of
      Christianity as well as of Mohammedanism is that the sword which the king
      carries has been blessed and put in his hands that he may put down the
      heretics. The civil authorities then, in bringing Joan of Arc to the fire
      were carrying out the instructions of the forty ecclesiastical judges who
      condemned her to death. Had these judges found her innocent, the state
      could not have destroyed her life; it was the will of the priestly court
      that she should die, and the secular authorities fulfilled its wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      But was Joan a heretic? Strenuous efforts are made to show that she was
      not. This point is a vital one. The church, in self-defense, is bound to
      produce arguments to prove that Joan of Arc was an orthodox, obedient, and
      submissive child of the church. If she was not orthodox, then the church
      has sainted a heretic in the person of Joan of Arc. One of the questions
      they asked her at the trial was whether she would be willing to submit the
      question of her "visions" to the church; that is to say, would she consent
      to the findings of an ecclesiastical court concerning herself and her
      mission? To this the answer was that she held herself responsible only to
      God. This was considered a rebellious answer, and it was&mdash;from the
      church's point of view. According to Catholic theology the church is
      divided into two branches,&mdash;the church militant, which is composed of
      the pope, the priests and their flock; and the church triumphant, which is
      presided over by God and the saints in glory. Joan said she was prepared
      to submit to the church triumphant&mdash;the church on high, that is to
      say, to God, but to nobody else. This also was a heresy. Her clerical
      judges insisted that to be a good Catholic she must bow to the will of the
      church on earth&mdash;the pope and his representatives. Her heresy then
      was both real and serious. She appealed from the pope to God. She placed
      her own conscience above the authority of the church. She believed in
      private judgment, the exercise of which is forbidden by the church. In
      refusing to let the pope act as the middleman between God and herself she
      was threatening the very existence of the papacy. There is then no doubt
      that both by her independent conduct and by her original answers Joan
      attacked the very fundamentals of Catholicism. It follows, then, that the
      pope a few years ago made a saint out of a heretic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Joan was an uncultivated girl, able neither to read nor write,
      she was gifted with good common sense. She saw at a glance that if she
      were to submit to the church she would thereby be casting doubts upon the
      genuineness of her "visions." She preferred to go to the stake rather than
      do that. She was really between two fires: the priests threatened her
      body; God in her conscience threatened her soul. She decided to obey the
      voice within. The decision cost her her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the questions put to her and the answers which Joan made are
      really remarkable. They show the craft of her judges, on the one hand, and
      the courage and common sense of the victim, on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you not submit to our holy father, the Pope?" they asked her. "Bring
      me before the Pope, and I will answer," she replied. In other words, they
      were trying to have her admit that she had no right to think for herself
      or to exercise any independence at all. But she was too serious and
      earnest a person to subscribe to any such doctrine. She had never
      understood that to be a Catholic meant to be a bondswoman. "Take care,"
      she said, turning her fiery glance upon her inquisitors, "take care that
      you do not put yourselves in the place of God." By such an answer, the
      young woman, still in her teens, had shot the Catholic Church in the
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nature of the charges against Joan as formulated by her judges also
      goes to prove that she was considered a heretic and condemned to death for
      that offense. The eleventh charge against her reads: "She has adored her
      saints without taking clerical advice." Charge twelfth reads: "She refuses
      to submit her conduct and revelation to the church." When asked if she
      would obey the church, her reply was, "God first being served." Luther
      said no more than that&mdash;and the Catholic church was split in two.
      Everything goes to show that the Domremy peasant girl was a private
      thinker, that is to say, a heretic. Listen to this: "I will believe that
      our Holy Father, the pope of Rome and the bishops and other churchmen are
      for the guarding of the Christian faith and the punishment of heretics, <i>but
      as for me and my facts, I will only submit to the church of heaven</i>."
      To be sure that is insubordination; it is placing herself not only on an
      equality with the pope, but even above him. Of course, Joan was not a
      Rationalist&mdash;far from it&mdash;but she was an independent Catholic&mdash;that
      is to say&mdash;not subject to the church&mdash;and that is heresy. Is it
      any wonder that her sentence read: "Therefore we pronounce you a rotten
      limb, and as such to be lopped off from the church." And the reason this
      sentence gave satisfaction to the Catholics all over the world was because
      such initiative and self-respect as Joan had manifested, if tolerated,
      would bring about the collapse of the infallible authority of the church.
      The University of Paris wrote to the pope, to the king of England and the
      bishops, lauding the priests who had purged the church of this dangerous
      girl with her "I think so," or "I believe so,"&mdash;with the emphasis on
      the "I." In this same letter the Bishop of Beauvais, the evil genius of
      Joan, to whom she said, when she saw the stake awaiting her, "Bishop, I
      die through you!" is commended for "his great gravity and holy way of
      proceeding, which ought to be most satisfactory to all."
    </p>
    <p>
      It took five hundred years for the Catholic Church to discover that the
      young woman burnt as a heretic was really a saint. But the church did not
      make this discovery until modern thought, benign and brave, had taken the
      outcast girl under its protection. The French nation had already made a
      national heroine of her, when the Vatican decided to enroll her name among
      the hallowed ones in its calendar. The beatification of Joan was brought
      about ostensibly by the report that certain sufferers from cancer, and
      other incurable maladies, had been completely cured by praying to Joan of
      Arc for help. The Maid had become a miracle worker, and hence worthy to
      receive a medal, as it were, from the pope. Joan is now a new income as
      well as a saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan owes her Vindication to the Rationalists of France. The man in recent
      years whose books, position and influence did more than anything else to
      bring about a new attitude toward Joan of Arc, was Marcelin Berthelot, who
      now sleeps in the Pantheon as one of the glories of his country. A few
      years ago, I received an invitation to visit him at Bellevue near Paris.
      To give you an idea of the great man who did so much to rejuvenate Europe
      and throw its whole weight on the side of justice to the Martyr&mdash;woman
      of France. I shall reproduce in this connection what I said about him
      after my interview with him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are the Rationalists?" is one of the questions frequently asked.
      Well, they are the intellectual leaders of the world, as what I learned
      about Berthelot clearly shows. He was the man upon whom two European
      sovereigns had conferred the highest decorations in their power for
      services rendered to human progress,&mdash;whom his own countrymen had
      honored by making him a senator for life; who twice had been appointed
      minister of foreign affairs; who had been elected an honorary member of
      all the scientific associations of the world; upon whom the Royal
      Scientific Society of London has bestowed its most coveted honors; who is
      the perpetual secretary of the Academy of Science of Paris; a member of
      the Academy Française, and, therefore, one of the immortals; and whose
      volumes, inventions, discoveries and contributions have placed modern
      civilization under inexpressible obligations to him. With all these
      dignities and titles, richly deserved, M. Berthelot is as gracious in his
      manners, as unassuming, as childlike and modest, as one could desire. He
      displays all the charms of the real man of worth&mdash;the man of genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though in his seventy-sixth year, the sage and diplomat still possessed
      the vigor of a man of fifty, pursuing his studies and interesting himself
      in the politics of his time, with the ardor and fervor of youth. The
      accumulation of his years and his indefatigable labors had by no means
      impaired the faculties of his mind, being still regarded by his countrymen
      as one of the most fertile brains and sanest intellects of modern Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years previously all France, one might say, had met in Paris to
      celebrate at the Sorbonne the completion of Berthelot's fifty years of
      intellectual labor. It was on this occasion that the foreign potentates
      sent their delegates and decorations to him. Every civilized country was
      represented at the festivities by its foremost men of letters and
      diplomats, while all the senators of France, the president of the
      republic, the members of his cabinet, and all the heads of the colleges
      were assembled to applaud the <i>master</i> whose half a century of study
      and service had so greatly augmented the horizon of man and increased the
      light of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this distinguished scientist was admitted into the French Academy,
      Jules Lemaitre, in his address of welcome, declared that Berthelot was the
      real creator of the modern industrial era, which had multiplied the
      resources of man a hundredfold. He called Berthelot the discoverer of
      modern chemistry, which has in so short a time transformed the face of the
      earth, and which holds the secret of the solution of the social and
      economic problems of the day. "'Chemistry" declares Berthelot, "'is a new
      gospel, which brings tidings of great power to mankind.'" "It will put an
      end to the cruel struggle of classes, and make of warlike politics, now
      one of the scourges of nations, a lost art. It will do this by placing
      within the reach of all an inexhaustible wealth of food and raiment,
      thereby curing man forever of the disease of discontent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are only two things worth living for," said M. Berthelot, in an
      address at the Palais de Trocadero before six thousand Frenchmen&mdash;"the
      love of truth and the love of one's fellows."
    </p>
    <p>
      That <i>love of truth</i> opened for Joan the doors of the Catholic
      Church, shut against her five hundred years ago and it opened to Berthelot
      the doors of the Pantheon&mdash;the Temple of the Immortals!
    </p>
    <p>
      A final word. I have as much compassion and sympathy for the Catholics as
      I have for the martyred girl&mdash;indeed more, since they need more. Joan
      has been vindicated by the broader and more benign thought of this! age.
      The same serene and sweet power will transform the Catholic Church and
      make it one of the most progressive forces of our America. I have
      delivered this lecture to hasten that lovely day!
